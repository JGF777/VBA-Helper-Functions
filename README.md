# VBA-Helper-Functions
Sub routines/Functions that perform different tasks  in other modules to automate financial reporting

The following module contains two key parts:

   1 - The following functions/sub routines are implemented as methods of one class that acts as a "helper" for many
       different projects that I've developed in my job. Their main purpose is to help in other modules
       that focus on automating monthly/weekly financial reports.

   2 - Userform sub routines that are responsible for making userform resizable or adding a maximize/
        minimize button. Note that they require prior declaration of other Windows API functions and private
       constants that are included as a commented block.

DISCLAIMER: I've tried to make those functions as dynamic as possible, however they could
be further adapted to other projects depending on each person's needs and the singularities of their
projects.
