# VBA-Helper-Functions
Sub routines/Functions that perform different tasks  in other modules to automate financial reporting


      - The following functions/sub routines are implemented as methods of one class that acts as a "helper" for many
       different projects that I've developed in my job. Their main purpose is to help in other modules
       that focus on automating monthly/weekly financial reports.


DISCLAIMER: I've tried to make those functions as dynamic as possible, however they could
be further adapted to other projects depending on each person's needs and the singularities of their
projects.
